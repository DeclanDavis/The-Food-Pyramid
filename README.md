# **TheFoodPyramid**
## **Overview**

The Food Pyramid is an app I developed as part of my module, **Web Information Processing**, in Maynooth University, National University of Ireland Maynooth.

This readme will provide an overview of the app. 

## **Brief**

Create an interactive food diary that allows users to record the different food shelf details for today and to record today's date.
Do not need to create a database, just work on the "front end", i.e. The Food Pyramid and interactive elements.

Requirements:
* Use HTML elements to create the pyramid, may not use images to create the structure.
* Colour and style settings must be achieved using *CSS*.
* Use "pure" *JavaScript* only. May not use any frameworks e.g. *React*, *jQuery*.
* Provide an indicator showing the number of items consumed on a particular shelf.
* Include buttons to increment or decrement the number of items on the shelf i.e. +/-.
* The shelf numbers should always be displayed, though the +/- buttons should only appear when you hover over a particular shelf.
* Have an interactive method for inputting the date.
* Include a gap between the level 1 and level 2, and level 2 and level 3.

Additionally:
*   Adjust the height of the individual Food Pyramid Shelves depending on the number of items on the shelf.
*   Update the colour of the circle containing the number of items depending on whether the number is greater, within or below the recommended guidelines.
*   Preserve the overall pyramid shape regardless of the height of individual shelves.
*   Include a method to switch between the two different food pyramid recommendations.
*   Provide some sort of date validation.
